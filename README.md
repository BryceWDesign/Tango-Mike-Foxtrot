# Tango-Mike-Foxtrot

> *A zero-fuel, zero-fan, no-maintenance drone platform designed to outperform traditional military propulsion systems — on a hobbyist budget.*

---

## 🚀 Overview
Tango-Mike-Foxtrot (TMF) is an experimental aerospace project aimed at creating an Earth-operable version of the IX-Darkstar propulsion concept. The objective: prove that plasma-shell propulsion layered with quantum flux guidance and ambient ion harvesting can function in real-world hobbyist drones.

This repository contains **full engineering diagrams, materials sourcing**, **performance specs**, and a **step-by-step guide to building the TMF prototype** — all designed to inspire innovation far beyond the status quo.

## 🖼️ SVG Rendering Issues on GitHub
GitHub does **not** reliably render SVGs inline in Markdown. If you attempt:

```md
![Drone Frame](hardware/frame_specs.svg)
```

You may see:
> "Error rendering embedded code  
> Invalid image source."

### ✅ Recommended Approach
- Use PNG versions for embedded previews in the README.
- Link to SVGs directly for full-resolution, zoomable viewing.

#### Example:
```md
![Frame Schematic](hardware/frame_specs.png)
[View vector version (SVG)](hardware/frame_specs.svg)
```

This ensures compatibility across browsers and devices without compromising quality or access.

## 💣 Mission Statement
> **I'm not here to make Lockheed Martin mad — just here to make them rethink everything.**

This is a thought experiment taken to its real-world conclusion. No fantasy. Every file in this repo is designed to be practical, reproducible, and bold enough to make even DARPA pause.

Welcome to Tango-Mike-Foxtrot.
