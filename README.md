## 🛰️ Overview

**Tango-Mike-Foxtrot** is a first-of-its-kind propulsion experiment engineered to break every convention in aerospace design:
- ✅ **No fans**
- ✅ **No fuel**
- ✅ **No moving parts in propulsion**
- ✅ **Solid-state pulse-based thrust**
- ✅ **Plasma-drag suppression architecture**

This is not a toy.  
This is a *serious, performance-focused counter-design* to conventional military drones, inspired by bleeding-edge DARPA/Lockheed platforms but reimagined from the ground up for **DIY buildability**, **experimental validation**, and **zero-maintenance field use**.

I've reverse-engineered known classified propulsion claims into an open-source hobbyist scale platform—with the audacity to scale further.

## 🚀 Current Prototype Capabilities

- **Electromagnetic pulse-vector propulsion grid** (non-aerodynamic thrust method)
- **Staged pulse capacitor discharge** logic with timing controllers
- **Early plasma shell envelope modeling** for aerodynamic drag cancellation
- **Thrust vector modulation** via selective firing of arc gates
- **Solid-state motion control** with zero propeller lift or burn-based output
- **Planned suborbital ride height launch via assistive platforms**

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Darkstar-inspired propulsion system relies on:
- **High-voltage pulse bursts** across a patterned emitter surface
- **Arc ionization** of surrounding air to create controlled miniature plasma jets
- **Nonlinear impulse generation** via pulse geometry and discharge symmetry
- **Plasma drag shell** to reduce or nullify conventional air resistance at speed

We simulate or test:
- Capacitor discharge behavior
- Pulse burst coherence and timing
- Discharge-to-motion relationships
- Energy-to-velocity ratios
- Drag envelope and plasma arc shaping at various densities

## 🎯 Roadmap to Mach 40

Currently operating within **subsonic-to-supersonic test envelopes** (Mach 0.5–4).  
However, based on core physical behavior already demonstrated or theorized in this repo, we are now committing to a staged performance climb to:

> ### 🧠 **Mach 40 Objective**  
> With the right staging altitude, drag-reduction geometry, and vector-pulse power stack, we aim to hit Mach 40 performance through non-combustion means.  

That means:
- High-altitude assist launches (balloon or sled to 60k–90k ft)
- Enhanced pulse bank design (nano-cap arrays or arc condensers)
- Plasma rail channeling with layered dielectric tuning
- Arc discharge alignment coils with discharge vector steering

We will not reach these velocities at sea-level. But we **can** and **will** approach orbital velocities under the right electromagnetic and geometric configurations. That is now this project’s public goal.

If it can be built, **we will build it**.  
If it can be tested, **we will test it**.  
If it can reach Mach 40, **this platform will prove it.**

## 🧩 SVG Rendering Notes

If GitHub throws **“Error rendering embedded code: Invalid image source”**, it may be due to:
- Inline SVG not supported in GitHub’s preview renderer
- Cross-linking or embedded JS/CSS references breaking
- Local path not compatible with GitHub web UI rendering

✅ I recommend viewing SVGs locally or using external preview tools.  
✅ Where needed, raster versions (PNG/WEBP) will be added for backup display.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project is a public experiment in:
- Replacing brute force with geometry
- Replacing propellant with energy
- Replacing noise with silence
- Replacing secrecy with transparency

I don’t expect the aerospace industry to welcome this.  
I expect it to **blush**.
