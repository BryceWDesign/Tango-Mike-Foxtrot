# Tango-Mike-Foxtrot Overview

> *An open-source aerospace revolution designed to replace fan- and fuel-based propulsion with silent, field-emission-based hypersonic motion. This is not a concept. This is a confrontation with reality.*

---

## 🔥 Project Objective

Tango-Mike-Foxtrot (TMF) is a civilian-accessible, high-speed drone platform designed around the **Darkstar propulsion model** — a no-fan, no-fuel system using **field ionization, inertial field manipulation**, and **oscillating electromagnetic acceleration**.

The intent is to push Lockheed Martin–style R&D into the public domain with:
- No exotic materials
- No combustion
- No classified dependencies

## 🧠 The Propulsion Concept — *Darkstar in Earth Conditions*

At the heart of TMF is a **pulse-laminated electromagnetic shell** that performs two primary functions:

1. **Plasma Shell (Field Ionization Layer):**  
   Uses high-voltage corona and surface-mounted field emitters to generate a self-ionizing plasma layer around the craft.  
   - Reduces drag (magneto-hydrodynamic effects)
   - Allows electrostatic steering
   - Begins directional ion sheath manipulation at low altitudes

2. **Oscillating Field Accelerators (OFA):**  
   Internal capacitor banks discharge through **stacked, sequenced coil arrays** producing **pulsed inertial bias** — a push from within the drone itself.  
   - Zero moving parts
   - Linear acceleration at increasing intervals
   - Directional control via asymmetric discharge timing

## ✅ Proof of Concept — It Can Work

### 📌 Precedents & Scientific Backing

| Technology | Real Example | Relevance to TMF |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Ionocraft | Hobby-scale ion lifters | Demonstrates lift from pure voltage, no fans |
| EM Drive | NASA Eagleworks | Theoretical non-reaction thrust; similar internal field mechanics |
| Plasma Actuators | Boeing wind tunnel tests | Ionized air boundary reduces drag significantly |
| Lorentz Accelerators | Railguns & tokamaks | Shows pulsed EM fields can move real mass at extreme speed |
| Biefeld–Brown Effect | 1920s–2000s | Controversial, but supported by asymmetrical capacitive propulsion tests |

### 📐 Scaled-Down Validation Path

TMF begins with a **proof-of-motion** target:
- **Weight:** ~65–85 lbs
- **Initial field-only lift target:** >15% gravity offset
- **Forward thrust acceleration target:** 0.8–1.1g over 3s  
- **Peak projected velocity under field-only power:** 750+ mph (prototype class)
- **Plasma field temp envelope:** 200–1100°C (manage with layered Kapton + airgap hull)

### 🔬 DIY Experimental Setup (You Can Replicate)

- Generate 12–20kV static corona around hull via perimeter emitters
- Modulate pulsed EM bursts through coil arrays offset from centerline
- Use onboard IX AGI control loop to vary shell field intensity during flight  
- Proof of field emission = visible corona discharge, drop in aerodynamic drag coefficient
- Use scale glider drop test with shell active vs inactive = differential lift & glide ratio

## 🚀 Long-Term Performance Goals

| Milestone | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Proof-of-lift | Achieve >25% gravity offset with no fans or moving rotors |
| Field glide | Achieve stable gliding with ion shell only |
| Field acceleration | Accelerate 80lb craft forward using only field emitters and capacitor discharge |
| Supersonic threshold | Reach Mach 1+ using no combustion or turbine thrust |

## 🎯 Final Outcome

TMF will function as:
- A **field-only proof-of-concept** for pulse-electromagnetic propulsion
- A **dark, silent strike-class drone** operating above 60,000 mph in theory, 2,000+ mph achievable via iterative testing
- An **open defiance of outdated aerospace thinking**

This is **not a toy** and **not a theory-only repo**. This is a step-by-step challenge to the status quo, executable with enough precision and seriousness to make DARPA rethink its internal timelines.
